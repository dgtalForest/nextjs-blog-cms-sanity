# A Next.js Blog with a Native Authoring Experience<!-- omit in toc -->

This project is a statically generated blog that uses [Next.js][nextjs] for the frontend and [Sanity][sanity-homepage] to handle its content. It comes with a native Sanity Studio that offers features like real-time collaboration and visual editing with live updates using [Presentation][presentation].

The Studio connects to Sanity Content Lake, which gives you hosted content APIs with a flexible query language, on-demand image transformations, powerful patching, and more. You can use this project to kick-start a blog or learn these technologies.



> [!NOTE]  
> This project uses the Next.js [Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages). [An App Router example is also available.](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/cms-sanity#readme)
